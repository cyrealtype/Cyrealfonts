FONTLOG for the Jacques Francois Shadow font

This file provides detailed information on the Jacques Francois Shadow
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Jacques Francois fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Jacques Francois Shadow is an incised variant of 
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Jacques+Francois">
Jacques Francois</a> font. 
Its letterforms are related to the Enschedé no. 811 type specimen
by J. F. Rosart. Compared to the historic specimen the x-height 
is generously increased and contrast lowered.

Jacques Francois Shadow is designed for large sizes 
and manually instructed for better screen performance starting
from 24 ppem. This means that on Window machines it 
will work best from 18 pt(@96ppi) or 15 pt(@120ppi),
and from 24 pt on Mac(@72ppi).

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1
